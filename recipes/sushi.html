    <h2 class="text">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="text ingrediants">
        <li>Sushi rice</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>avocado</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Tobiko</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text information">
        <li>Lay the bamboo sushi rolling mat on a cutting board 
            with bamboo strips going horizontally from you. 
            Cover the bamboo with a piece of plastic wrap. 
            Put a sheet of dried seaweed on top of the mat, 
            shiny side down. Spread cooked rice on top of the seaweed 
            in a thin layer and press firmly.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the sushi layer over so that the seaweed is on top. 
            Place shrimp tempura, avocado and cream cheese lengthwise 
            at the top of the sheet on the seaweed, not on top of the rice.
            Roll the bamboo mat forward, pressing the ingredients inside the
            cylinder-shaped sushi (the KEY is to roll it TIGHT). Press the bamboo
            mat firmly with hands, then remove the rolled sushi. For further 
            rolling instruction, see the video below.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the roll in flour then dip entire rice roll
            in tempura batter and deep fry (oil heated to 350-degrees)
            or about 3 minutes or until batter turns crispy and golden 
            brown (you DON'T need to do this in a deep fryer. You can
            just do about ½ cup – 1 cup of oil in a frying pan and
            keep turning the roll until it is golden brown on all
            sides). Remove from oil and let cool for a few minutes.
            With a VERY sharp knife, cut the sushi roll into 4-5 pieces. 
            Top with spicy mayo.
        </li>
    </ol>
